# MyExperimentsWithJava
Collection of different java problems, techniques and tutorials

## Setup
1. Download/Clone the repositoy
2. Open Eclipse -> File -> Import -> Import Gradle Project
3. Next..next..next..finish!

## Overview
* The project mainly divided into three main packages
  * algorithms
  * problems
  * utils

* The *algorithm* package contains popular algorithms implementation commonly divided by the datastructure that it uses e.g.
  * linkedlist
  * trees
  
  *or* sometimes the functionality it provides
  * search
  * sort

* The *problems* package simiarly contains competitive programming problems divided by the datastructure that it uses e.g.
  * linkedlist
  * trees
  
  *or* sometimes the type of the problem
  * dynamic programming(dp)
  * greedy approach

* The *utils* package contains all the utility classes like InputReader, FastInputReader..etc.. that are used in the project.
